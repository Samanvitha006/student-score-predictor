# 🎯 Student Score Predictor

A simple and interactive machine learning web app that predicts a student's final exam score based on the number of hours they studied. Built using Python, Streamlit, and Scikit-learn.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts final exam scores using Linear Regression
- Clean and interactive web interface
- R² Score: **0.84** (good model performance)
- Built for learning and showcasing ML concepts
- Web-ready using Streamlit

## 📊 Dataset

A randomly generated realistic dataset of student study hours and exam scores.

| Hours Studied | Final Exam Score |
|---------------|------------------|
| 2.5           | 50               |
| 5.0           | 70               |
| 7.5           | 88               |
| ...           | ...              |
